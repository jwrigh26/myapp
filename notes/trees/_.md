### Trees
1. **Understand Basic Types**
   - Binary Tree
   - Binary Search Tree (BST)
   - N-ary Tree

2. **Key Traversals**
   - Preorder, Inorder, Postorder (recursive and iterative)
   - Level Order (Breadth-First Search)

3. **Key Concepts**
   - Height and Depth of a Tree
   - Balancing a Tree (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees)
   - Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

4. **Problems to Practice**
   - Validate a BST
   - Find the maximum depth of a binary tree
   - Symmetric Tree (check if a tree is mirrored)
   - Path Sum (find paths with a given sum)
   - Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree
