Binary search is a fundamental algorithm for efficient searching in sorted datasets. Here's a focused way to learn it:

---

### **What is Binary Search?**
- A divide-and-conquer algorithm that repeatedly splits the search space in half.
- Works only on sorted arrays or conditions that can be translated into a sorted pattern.

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Basic Binary Search**
   - Goal: Find a target element in a sorted array.
   - Steps:
     1. Start with two pointers: `left` and `right`.
     2. Calculate the mid-point.
     3. Check if the target is at the mid, or adjust the pointers (`left = mid + 1` or `right = mid - 1`).

2. **Binary Search on Answer**
   - Used to solve optimization problems by searching a range of possible answers.
   - Example: Find the smallest/largest value that satisfies a condition.

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty arrays or single-element arrays.
   - Off-by-one errors when calculating the mid-point.
   - Floating-point precision for real-number searches.

### **Advanced Techniques**
1. **Variations**
   - Find the first occurrence of an element.
   - Find the last occurrence of an element.
   - Find the smallest element greater than or equal to a target.
   - Find the largest element less than or equal to a target.

2. **Applications**
   - Search in rotated sorted arrays.
   - Searching in infinite sorted arrays (simulate infinite by doubling the range).
   - Peak element in a mountain array.

3. **2D Binary Search**
   - Search in a row-wise and column-wise sorted matrix.

---

### **Practice Problems**
1. **Basic**
   - Search a target in a sorted array.
   - Find the square root of a number using binary search.

2. **Intermediate**
   - Search for an element in a rotated sorted array.
   - Find the peak element in an array.

3. **Advanced**
   - Allocate books (minimum pages assigned to students).
   - Find the median of two sorted arrays.

---

### **Common Mistakes**
- Forgetting to update pointers correctly when the target is not found.
- Using the wrong comparison operator (`<`, `<=`, etc.).
- Overflow issues when calculating the mid-point: `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
