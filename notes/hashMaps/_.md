Hash maps are an incredibly versatile data structure and are foundational for solving many problems efficiently. Here's a guide to learning them:

---

### **What is a Hash Map?**
- A data structure that maps keys to values for quick lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- Operates in **O(1)** time on average due to hashing.

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **How It Works**
   - Hash Function: Converts a key into an index.
   - Collisions: When two keys hash to the same index, resolved using:
     - Chaining (linked lists at each index).
     - Open Addressing (probing for the next empty slot).

2. **Hash Maps in Practice**
   - In Python: `dict`
   - In JavaScript: `Map` or `{}` (object)
   - In Java: `HashMap`

3. **Common Operations**
   - Insert: `map[key] = value`
   - Lookup: `map.get(key)`
   - Delete: `map.delete(key)` (or equivalent)
   - Iterate: Loop through keys or key-value pairs.

### **Applications**
1. **Counting**
   - Example: Count the frequency of elements in an array.
   - Example: Find the first unique character in a string.

2. **Memoization**
   - Use in dynamic programming to store results of subproblems.

3. **Fast Lookups**
   - Example: Check if two arrays share any elements.
   - Example: Find two numbers in an array that sum to a target (`Two Sum` problem).

4. **Grouping**
   - Example: Group anagrams from a list of words.
   - Example: Group numbers by modulo or category.

5. **Custom Mappings**
   - Map complex keys (e.g., tuple keys) to values.

---

### **Practice Problems**
1. **Easy**
   - Two Sum (find indices of two numbers adding up to a target).
   - Find if a given array contains duplicates.

2. **Intermediate**
   - Group Anagrams.
   - Subarray Sum Equals K.

3. **Advanced**
   - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.
   - Minimum Window Substring (find the smallest window containing all characters of another string).

---

### **Common Mistakes**
- Forgetting to handle collisions in custom implementations.
- Misunderstanding hash map limitations (e.g., not suited for range queries).
- Using mutable keys (e.g., lists) in languages that disallow them (e.g., Python).
