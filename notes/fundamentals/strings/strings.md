   - **Time Complexity**:
     - All approaches: \(O(n)\).
   - **Space Complexity**:
     - Recursive slice-based: \(O(n)\) (due to new substrings and call stack).
     - Iterative: \(O(1)\).
     - Pointer-based recursive: \(O(n)\) (due to call stack).
     - Pointer-based iterative: \(O(1)\).
   - Include a simple table summarizing pros, cons, and complexities.

### **7. Writing Tests**
   - Importance of testing your functions.
   - Examples of test cases:
     - Normal palindromes (e.g., "madam").
     - Non-palindromes (e.g., "javascript").
     - Edge cases (e.g., empty string, single character).
   - Mention how testing ensures correctness and prevents regressions.

### **8. Final Thoughts**
   - Recap key learnings:
     - Different approaches to solving the same problem.
     - When to use each approach (e.g., recursion for elegance, pointers for efficiency).
   - Encourage readers to try implementing and testing these on their own.
   - Mention how solving small problems like this builds a strong foundation for tackling more complex algorithms.

### **9. Appendix (Optional)**
   - Link to your test suite or GitHub repo.
   - Additional resources for learning about recursion, pointers, or algorithm optimization.
