### **Key Concepts in String Manipulation**

1. **String Basics**

   - Understanding immutable strings (most languages) vs. mutable strings (e.g., Python lists, Java `StringBuilder`).
   - Common operations: concatenation, slicing, indexing.

2. **Pattern Matching**

   - Checking substrings.
   - Using sliding windows for substring problems.
   - Finding anagrams or permutations.

3. **String Transformation**

   - Reversing a string or words in a sentence.
   - Changing cases (e.g., upper to lower, vice versa).
   - Removing or replacing characters.

4. **Advanced Concepts**
   - String compression (e.g., "aaabb" → "a3b2").
   - Palindromes and their variations.
   - Longest common prefix/suffix.

### **Common Algorithms**

1. **Reversing Strings**

   - Reverse the whole string or reverse in-place.

2. **Search Algorithms**

   - Naive substring search.
   - Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) for pattern matching.
   - Rabin-Karp for searching using hashing.

3. **Dynamic Programming on Strings**

   - Longest Common Subsequence.
   - Longest Palindromic Substring.
   - Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance).

4. **Hashing Techniques**
   - Rolling hash for substring problems.
   - Using hash maps for frequency counts (e.g., find anagrams).

### **Practice Problems**

1. **Easy**

   - Check if a string is a palindrome.
   - Count vowels and consonants in a string.
   - Find the first unique character in a string.

2. **Intermediate**

   - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.
   - Group Anagrams.
   - Implement strstr() (find a substring in a string).

3. **Advanced**
   - Longest Palindromic Substring.
   - Minimum Window Substring (find the smallest window in a string containing all characters of another string).
   - Implement a basic regex matcher.

### **String Techniques**

1. **Sliding Window**
   - Example: Finding all substrings of a fixed or variable length.
2. **Two Pointers**
   - Example: Check if two strings are rotations of each other.
3. **Trie Data Structure**
   - Useful for prefix-based problems.

### **Common Mistakes**

- Mismanaging indices during substring operations.
- Not considering edge cases (empty strings, single characters).
- Ignoring case-sensitivity or special characters in problems.
