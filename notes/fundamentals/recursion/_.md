Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and a key skill for solving many algorithmic problems. Here's a roadmap to learning recursion:

### **What is Recursion?**

- A function that calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
- Typically involves:
  1. **Base Case**: The condition where the recursion stops.
  2. **Recursive Case**: The function calls itself with a smaller input.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Base Case and Recursive Case**

   - Without a base case, recursion leads to infinite calls (stack overflow).
   - Example: Factorial calculation.
     ```python
     def factorial(n):
         if n == 0:  # Base case
             return 1
         return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case
     ```

2. **Call Stack**

   - Understand how each function call is added to the stack.
   - The stack unwinds after reaching the base case.

3. **Tail Recursion**

   - A type of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation.
   - Optimizable in some languages to prevent stack overflow.

   Using JS what is an example of tail recusion:

### **Applications of Recursion**

1. **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**
   - Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.
2. **Tree Traversals**
   - Preorder, Inorder, Postorder.
3. **Graph Algorithms**
   - Depth-First Search (DFS).
4. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Solving overlapping subproblems.
5. **Backtracking**
   - Generating permutations, subsets, solving N-Queens.

### **Practice Problems**

1. **Easy**

   - Calculate the factorial of a number.
   - Compute the nth Fibonacci number.
   - Reverse a string.

2. **Intermediate**

   - Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
   - Generate all subsets of a set.
   - Find all permutations of a string or array.

3. **Advanced**
   - Solve a maze using backtracking.
   - Sudoku Solver.
   - Word Search in a 2D board.

### **Common Mistakes**

1. Forgetting the base case, leading to infinite recursion.
2. Overlapping subproblems (optimize with memoization).
3. Poor choice of parameters or recursion depth (causing stack overflow).

### **Tips for Mastering Recursion**

1. Visualize the call stack with simple examples.
2. Write out the base and recursive cases clearly before coding.
3. Debug by printing intermediate steps.
