The sliding window technique is a powerful algorithmic pattern for solving problems involving arrays or strings. Here’s how you can approach learning it:
Fixed-size Sliding Window
Variable-size Sliding Window

### **What is the Sliding Window Technique?**

- Used to solve problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.
- Efficiently finds sums, averages, or patterns without recalculating from scratch.

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Fixed Window Size**

   - Used when the size of the window is known.
   - Example: Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.

2. **Dynamic Window Size**

   - Used when the size of the window can change based on conditions.
   - Example: Find the smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to `target`.

3. **Two Pointers**
   - Often used to shrink or grow the window dynamically.
   - Example: Find the longest substring with at most `k` distinct characters.

---

### **Steps to Apply Sliding Window**

1. Define the window (start and end pointers).
2. Expand the window (move the end pointer).
3. Check the condition and adjust (shrink the window by moving the start pointer if needed).
4. Track the desired result (e.g., max sum, min length).

### **Practice Problems**

1. **Fixed Window**

   - Maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.
   - Find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size `k`.

2. **Dynamic Window**

   - Smallest subarray with a sum ≥ `target`.
   - Longest substring with `k` unique characters.
   - Longest substring without repeating characters.

3. **Advanced Problems**
   - Find all anagrams of a pattern in a string.
   - Minimum window substring containing all characters of a pattern.

---

### **Common Mistakes**

- Forgetting to shrink the window when the condition is violated.
- Incorrectly updating variables when moving the pointers.
- Misunderstanding when to expand or shrink the window.
