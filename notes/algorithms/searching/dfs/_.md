Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are core algorithms for exploring graphs and trees. Here's how to approach learning them:

---

### **DFS (Depth-First Search)**

1. **Concepts**
   - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
   - Works on graphs and trees (both directed and undirected).
   - Can be implemented using recursion (call stack) or an explicit stack.

2. **Key Variations**
   - Preorder, Inorder, Postorder Traversals for trees.
   - Iterative DFS using a stack.
   - Recursive DFS for graphs.

3. **Applications**
   - Detecting cycles in a graph.
   - Checking connectivity.
   - Topological sorting (for Directed Acyclic Graphs).
   - Solving puzzles like mazes.

4. **Practice Problems**
   - Count connected components in a graph.
   - Find all paths from source to destination in a graph.
   - Find all or something is a key clue it requires backtracking.
   - Solve a maze or island-count problem.

### **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**

1. **Concepts**
   - Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper.
   - Uses a queue for implementation.

2. **Applications**
   - Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
   - Level order traversal of a tree.
   - Solving problems like "minimum steps to reach a destination."

3. **Practice Problems**
   - Shortest path in a binary maze.
   - Find the number of connected components in a graph.
   - Word Ladder problem (transform one word into another).

---

### **Comparing DFS and BFS**
- DFS is good for exploring all solutions (e.g., backtracking problems like Sudoku).
- BFS is optimal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

---

### **Problems Combining Both**
- Solving the "Knight's shortest path" problem on a chessboard.
- Detecting bipartite graphs.
