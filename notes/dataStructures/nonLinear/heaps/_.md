### **What to Learn About Heaps**

1. **Understand the Basics**

   - What is a Heap?
     - Binary Heap: A complete binary tree where each node satisfies the heap property.
     - Min-Heap: Parent nodes are smaller than their children.
     - Max-Heap: Parent nodes are larger than their children.
   - Common Use Cases:
     - Priority Queues
     - Finding the Kth largest/smallest element
     - Efficient sorting (Heap Sort)

2. **Heap Operations**

   - Insert a node
   - Delete the root
   - Heapify (adjust the tree to maintain the heap property)
   - Build a heap from an array

3. **Heap Implementations**

   - Binary Heaps (using arrays for storage)
   - Fibonacci Heaps and Binomial Heaps (advanced, optional at this stage)

4. **Problems to Practice**

   - Find the Kth largest or smallest element in an array.
   - Merge K sorted arrays.
   - Top K frequent elements in a list.
   - Stream median (maintain the median while streaming numbers).
   - Implement a priority queue using a heap.

5. **Advanced Applications (Optional)**
   - Dijkstra’s Algorithm (uses a min-heap for the priority queue)
   - Huffman Encoding (construct a tree using heaps)

Stacks are a fundamental data structure used in many algorithms and problem-solving techniques. Here's how you can approach learning about stacks:

Heaps are an advanced data structure that is extremely useful in solving optimization problems and implementing priority queues. Here’s how you can structure your learning:

### **What is a Heap?**

- A **complete binary tree** where:
  - **Min-Heap**: The parent node is smaller than or equal to its children.
  - **Max-Heap**: The parent node is greater than or equal to its children.
- **Binary Heap**: Typically implemented as an array for efficiency.

---

### **How Heaps Work**

1. **Heap Properties**

   - All levels except the last are completely filled.
   - Nodes are filled left to right in the last level.

2. **Operations**

   - **Insert**:
     - Add the element to the end and "heapify up" to restore the heap property.
   - **Delete/Extract**:
     - Remove the root and replace it with the last element, then "heapify down."
   - **Peek**:
     - Return the root element without removing it (O(1)).

3. **Implementation**
   - Store the heap as an array:
     - Parent at index `i`, children at indices `2i + 1` (left) and `2i + 2` (right).
     - Parent of node `i` is at `(i - 1) // 2`.

### **Applications of Heaps**

1. **Priority Queues**

   - Efficiently manage tasks based on priority.
   - Example: CPU scheduling.

2. **Heap Sort**

   - Sort elements using a heap.
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n).

3. **Top-K Problems**

   - Find the largest or smallest `k` elements in an array.

4. **Median in a Stream**

   - Use two heaps: a max-heap for the lower half and a min-heap for the upper half.

5. **Graph Algorithms**

   - Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm (priority queue implementation).
   - Prim’s minimum spanning tree.

6. **Merging Sorted Arrays**
   - Use a min-heap to efficiently merge multiple sorted arrays.

---

### **Practice Problems**

1. **Basic**

   - Implement a min-heap and max-heap.
   - Extract the smallest/largest element from a heap.

2. **Intermediate**

   - Find the Kth largest or smallest element in an array.
   - Merge `k` sorted arrays using a heap.

3. **Advanced**
   - Median of a data stream.
   - Find the largest `k` elements in a matrix sorted row-wise and column-wise.

---

### **Common Mistakes**

1. Misunderstanding the heap property (confusing min-heap with max-heap).
2. Incorrectly calculating indices for parent and child nodes in the array.
3. Forgetting to re-heapify after insertions or deletions.

### **What is a Stack?**

- A collection of elements with **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** behavior.
- Key Operations:
  - **Push**: Add an element to the top.
  - **Pop**: Remove the top element.
  - **Peek/Top**: View the top element without removing it.
  - **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.

---

### **How Stacks Are Implemented**

1. **Using Arrays/Lists**:
   - Example: Python `list`, JavaScript `Array`.
2. **Using Linked Lists**:
   - Useful when the stack size is unknown or dynamic.

---

### **Applications of Stacks**

1. **Expression Evaluation and Conversion**

   - Evaluate postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) expressions.
   - Convert infix to postfix or prefix expressions.

2. **Balancing Parentheses**

   - Check for balanced brackets in a string (e.g., `"{[()]}"`).

3. **Undo/Redo Operations**

   - Implemented using two stacks to track actions.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

   - Iterative DFS uses a stack to simulate recursion.

5. **Function Call Stack**

   - Tracks function calls in recursive programs.

6. **Sorting**

   - Sort a stack using recursion or another stack.

7. **Next Greater/Smaller Element**
   - Use stacks to find the next greater or smaller element for every array element.

---

### **Problems to Practice**

1. **Easy**

   - Implement a stack using arrays.
   - Check if parentheses are balanced.
   - Reverse a stack using recursion.

2. **Intermediate**

   - Design a stack that supports `getMin()` in O(1) time.
   - Implement a stack using two queues (and vice versa).
   - Evaluate postfix expressions.

3. **Advanced**
   - Find the largest rectangle in a histogram.
   - Implement a monotonic stack for problems like "Next Greater Element."
   - Use stacks for string decoding (e.g., `3[a2[bc]]` → `abcbcabcbc`).

---

### **Common Mistakes**

1. Misunderstanding stack behavior (e.g., thinking it’s FIFO like a queue).
2. Forgetting edge cases (e.g., popping from an empty stack).
3. Confusing stack implementation with array operations in some languages.
