CS 101 How to pass the interview 

algorithm and data structures

binary search
dfs & bfs
graphs
hashMaps
linked lists
recursion
sliding windows
sorts ( selective sort, merge sort, etc )
stack heaps
strings
trees

Those are the main folders I have so far, but I am not married to how I have things laid out. In fact I don't like it that much and wondering if you could help organize my content.

I am thinking 3 levels, main level would be like alogrithyms or data structures and under that would be sub topics like hash maps or sorting and then under there I would but routes to various pages related to said topic that i want to study.

Hoping you could provide some insight on what to remove, include, and how to organize so I can start to tackle the mountian of knowledge i need to start mastering for whiteboarding and computer science interview questions.
