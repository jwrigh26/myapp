Division:

# 1. Key Words:

- Dividend -> the number being divided (the "big number" you start with).
- Divisor -> the number your dividing by.
- Quotient -> the result ( how many times the divisor fits ).
- Remainder -> what's left over.

# 2. Fraction vs. Division Symbol:

- 12 ÷ 3 = 4
- 12 / 3 = 4

Both mean the same.

- The top of the fraction is always the dividend ( TOP DOG )
- The bottom of the fraction is always the divisor ( Sleeps outside the dog house )

Anchor: "The dog (dividend) goes inside the house. Bottom dog (divisor) stays outside."

# 3. Long Division House

When you write long division:

---

3 | 12

- 12 is the dividend (inside the house).
- 3 is the divisor (outside the house).
- 4 is the quotient (on top of the house).

Anchor: "Divisor goes outside, Dividend goes inside."

# 4. Step Order in Long Division

Here's the chang many teachers use:
Divide -> Multiple -> Subtract -> Bring Down -> Repeat.

Example 13

- 13 ÷ 4 = 3 R1
- Divide 4 goes into 13 -> 3 times.
- Multiply 4 x 3 = 12
- Subtract 13 -12 = 1
- Bring down: ( nothing left, so stop ).
- Answer: Quotient = 3, Remainder - 1.

# 5. Why This Gets Jumbled

- When you say it out loud, "12 divided by 3" - your brain may flip the order.
- But if you always check with a fration: "12 divided by 3" = 12/3, you'll place it right.
  - You will know 12 is the Dividend and 3 is the divisor.

New Anchor Sentence:

- "Dividend goes on top ( or inside ), Divisor goes on the bottom ( or outside )."

# RECIPROCALS

Reciprocals help us determine how many times a specific fratction fits into the whole number 1.

- A reciprocal is always defined in relation to 1.

Example: The reiprocal of 2/3 is 3/2 because 2/3 \* 3/2 = 1.

Reciprocals aren't about any whole number. They're specifically about making the prodcut equal to 1.

The reciprocal of a number is what your multiply it by to get 1.

Kid Friendly Version:
A reciprocal tells us how many times a number fits into 1.

Example: 1/4 fits into 1 exactly 4 times -> it's reciprocal is 4/1.
5 fits into 1 exactly 1/5 of a time -> it reciprocal is 1/5.

So if a the number is a fration, flip it.
If the number is a whole number, put 1 over it.
