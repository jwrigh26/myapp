# Self‑Edit Checklist (AI & Me)

> A quick pass you can do before sending me a draft. Keep your voice. I’ll polish the rest.

## 1) Basics First

- [ ] **Typos**: fix obvious spelling mistakes.
- [ ] **Punctuation**: periods end sentences; commas only where they help.
- [ ] **Quotes**: smart quotes for titles/phrases if needed.
- [ ] **Capitalization**: product names (Copilot, Stack Overflow), acronyms (API, AI).

## 2) Sentence-Level Cleanups

- [ ] **Run-ons**: split long sentences into two. If you hear yourself taking a breath, it may be two sentences.
- [ ] **Commas**: remove extra commas that interrupt flow. Example: “What do you mean by ‘mostly’?” (no comma after _by_).
- [ ] **Hyphens**: use only when needed (e.g., run-on sentence, full-time). Avoid random hyphens in verbs (pair program).

## 3) Active vs. Passive

- [ ] If you can add **“by zombies”** to the verb, it’s passive. Prefer active when clarity matters.
  - Passive: “All illustrations are done by me.”
  - Active: “I create all the illustrations.”
- [ ] Keep passive **only** when the doer doesn’t matter or when it reads smoother.

## 4) Flow & Coherence

- [ ] **One idea per sentence**; one focus per paragraph.
- [ ] **Lead lines**: start paragraphs with a clear claim, then support it.
- [ ] **Bridges**: use short connectors: “Even so,” “That’s why,” “In short,” “For example.”
- [ ] **Lists beat walls of text** when you’re naming more than 2–3 items.

## 5) Repetition (Good vs. Clunky)

- [ ] Good repetition for rhythm or emphasis? Keep it.
- [ ] Clunky repetition that jars the ear? Change one instance or trim.
  - Example clunky: “time saver… time saver…”
  - Fix: swap one for **time savings**, **efficiency**, or cut.

## 6) Clichés & Filler

- [ ] Kill vague filler: “in order to,” “very,” “really,” “actually.”
- [ ] Replace clichés with your own phrasing. If it sounds like a poster, rewrite it.

## 7) Tone & Voice

- [ ] Keep it **you**: casual, plain, direct.
- [ ] Prefer short words over fancy synonyms unless the fancy word is the precise word.
- [ ] Avoid em dashes unless they truly help. Prefer periods or commas.

## 8) AI Usage Disclosures (for FAQs)

- [ ] Be specific: what AI helped with (grammar, brainstorming, boilerplate).
- [ ] State the human part: reading docs, verifying sources, your own drafts.
- [ ] Brand names correct: **Copilot**, **Stack Overflow**.

## 9) Quick Examples (Before → After)

- “I use AI where I feel it makes sense.” → “I use AI when it makes sense.”
- “All illustrations are done by me.” → “I create all the illustrations.”
- “Replacing placeholder text; used in place of lorem ipsum.” → “Replace placeholder text (instead of lorem ipsum).”
- “However; I try and verify…” → “However, I try to verify…”

## 10) Final 30‑Second Pass

- [ ] Read it aloud once. Cut anything you stumble over.
- [ ] Check links, product names, and code terms.
- [ ] Make sure the last sentence lands cleanly.

**Tip:** If a sentence survives after you chop three words from it, keep the shorter one.
